# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

`wrap` is a Go-based orchestrator that wraps the `claude` Code CLI to run multi-agent software-development swarms. A user submits a project (via CLI, spec file, or GitHub issue); the orchestrator plans the work, spawns parallel `claude` workers in isolated git worktrees, merges their output, and emits a result. The internal product name is `wrap` (binaries: `wrap` CLI, `wrapd` daemon); the GitHub repo is `Lithial/ManageBot`. Use `wrap` in code and docs unless referring to the repo URL.

**Substrate:** wraps `claude -p` subprocesses, not the SDK or raw API. Workers must remain debuggable as standalone `claude -p` sessions.

**Status:** Phase 1 (skeleton) is merged. The full design lives in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-claude-swarm-wrapper-design.md`; each phase gets its own plan under `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Read the spec before extending architecture; read the relevant phase plan before starting implementation work.

Phase 2 (FSM + planner phase) is on branch `phase-2-fsm-and-planner`: introduces `internal/fsm` (pure phase transitions), `internal/worktree` (git plumbing), `internal/workerrpc` (NDJSON protocol mirroring the planned MCP tool surface), `internal/supervisor` (one-shot subprocess + RPC collection), and `internal/orchestrator` (polling loop that drives `pending → planning → plan_gate`). The planner subprocess is configurable via `wrapd --planner-cmd`; integration tests point it at `fake-claude` with `--planner-env FAKE_CLAUDE_SCRIPT=...` and `--tick-interval 100ms`.

Phase 3 (worker phase) is on branch `phase-3-worker-phase` (built atop phase 2): the orchestrator now drives `plan_gate → working → merging | failed`. New pieces: `internal/orchestrator/tasks.go` (parse + validate the plan's `tasks_json` DAG — unique ids, deps exist, acyclic), `scheduler.go` (pure DAG scheduler honoring a concurrency cap with transitive failure propagation, injectable `runTaskFunc`), `workers.go` (`driveWorkers`: a worktree + worker subprocess per task, outcome → terminal status, persisted `workers` rows), and `internal/store/workers.go`. Worker subprocess is configured via `wrapd --worker-cmd`/`--worker-env`/`--max-workers`; the happy path **terminates at `merging`** (the merger is Phase 4). See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-30-phase-3-worker-phase.md`.

Phase 4 (merger phase + basic emission) is on branch `phase-4-merger` (built atop phase 3): the orchestrator now drives `merging → merge_gate → done`. New pieces: `internal/store/events.go` (the `events` table — `InsertEvent`/`ListEventsByRun`/`LatestEventByKind` — first real use of the forensic/emission log), `internal/orchestrator/merger.go` (`driveMerger`: gather surviving worker branches + summaries, spawn the merger in a retained `wrap/<run>/merge` worktree, record a `merge_done` event, advance to `merge_gate`). Worker outcomes are now recorded as `worker_done`/`worker_blocked`/`worker_failed` events. The merger subprocess is configured via `wrapd --merger-cmd`/`--merger-env`; `GET /runs/{id}` exposes `merge_branch`/`merge_summary` (sourced from the `merge_done` event). Emission is **minimal** (events + API); the spec's step-7 adapter long-poll subscription is deferred. See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-phase-4-merger.md`.

Phase 5 (gate engine + plan/merge gates) is on branch `phase-5-gate-engine` (built atop phase 4): the `AutoAdvanceGates` scaffold is **deleted** and replaced by real `gates_json` policy. New pieces: `internal/gates` (pure `Policy`/`Parse`/`Mode`, defaulting to `require_approval`), `internal/store/gates.go` (`gates` table — `InsertGate`/`PendingGateByRun`/`LatestGateByKind`/`ResolveGate`/`ListGatesByRun`), and `internal/orchestrator/gates.go` (`drivePlanGate`/`driveMergeGate`: `auto` → auto-approved gate + proceed; `require_approval` → pending gate + `gate_requested` event + hold; rejection fails the run). Resolution surface: `POST /runs/{id}/approve|reject` and `wrap approve|reject <run-id>` (resolves the run's current pending gate); `GET /runs/{id}` exposes `pending_gate_kind`/`pending_gate_id`. The always-on `worker_blocked`/`merge_conflict` gates are **deferred** (they pause mid-phase). See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-phase-5-gate-engine.md`.

Phase 6 (TUI) is on branch `phase-6-tui` (built atop phase 5): a Bubble Tea terminal UI over the existing API — **no new daemon/orchestrator logic**. New pieces: `internal/tui` (a `Model` with `modeList`/`modeDetail`, poll-based via `tea.Tick`, talking to a `tui.DaemonClient` interface that `*client.Client` satisfies), one new read endpoint `GET /runs` (+ `store.ListRuns`, `client.ListRuns`, `intake.RunSummary`/`ListRunsResponse`), and `wrap tui` (dashboard) / `wrap attach <run-id>` (detail) commands. Gate approval reuses Phase 5's `approve`/`reject`. Adds `charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `lipgloss` deps. See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-phase-6-tui.md`.

Phase 7 (GitHub + specfile intake adapters + pull emission) is on branch `phase-7-intake-adapters` (built atop phase 6): two new adapters plus a pull-based emission command — **no new orchestration**. New pieces: `internal/intake/specfile.go` (`wrap submit <spec.md>`: `---` frontmatter for `project`/`repo`/`verification_command`, body is the spec; `intake_kind=specfile`), `internal/intake/github.go` (`wrap github <issue-ref>`: an `IssueFetcher` turns a GitHub issue into a run; `intake_kind=github`), and `internal/intake/emit.go` (`wrap emit <run-id>`: dispatch by `intake_kind` — cli→print branch, specfile→write `<spec>.DONE` sidecar, github→`git push` + `gh pr create`). `GET /runs/{id}` now exposes `intake_kind`/`intake_ref` so `emit` knows what to do. The spec's long-poll auto-dispatch emission is **deferred**; `wrap emit` is the (spec-sanctioned) manual trigger. See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-phase-7-intake-adapters.md`.

Phase 8 (failure modes) is on branch `phase-8-failure-modes` (built atop phase 7): worker retries, worker timeout, daemon-restart reconciliation, `wrap kill`, and optimistic-lock 409. New pieces: retry loop in `internal/orchestrator/workers.go` (`runWorkerAttempt` + `RetryBudget`; retryable = crash/timeout, never blocked/done; per-attempt worker rows; `worker_retry`/`worker_timeout` events), `internal/orchestrator/reconcile.go` (`Reconcile`, run by `wrapd` at startup: orphan running workers → `failed:daemon_restart`, mid-active-phase runs → `failed`, gate/pending runs resume, `daemon_recovered` event; `store.ListRunningWorkers`), `internal/orchestrator/kill.go` (`cancelRegistry` + `WatchKills`), and `POST /runs/{id}/kill` + `wrap kill`. `ResolveGate` is now conditional on `status='pending'` → `ErrGateNotPending` → `409`. See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-04-phase-8-failure-modes.md`.

Phase 9 (real MCP + e2e smoke) is on branch `phase-9-mcp` (built atop phase 8); it's split into 3 PRs — see `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-phase-9-mcp.md`. **9a (done):** `cmd/wrap-mcp` is the MCP stdio bridge `claude` spawns as a worker's `wrap` tool provider (built on the official `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`); it exposes the five `wrap.*` tools and relays each call to the daemon over the Unix socket, scoped by `--worker <id>`. The daemon grew worker-facing endpoints (`GET /workers/{id}/task|siblings`, `POST /workers/{id}/progress|done|blocked` → `worker_report_*` events) + `store.GetWorker` + client worker methods. **9b (next):** switch the orchestrator to determine outcomes from `worker_report_*` events + exit code (not stdout NDJSON), add `--mcp-config`/`--append-system-prompt` command templates + prompt files, and teach `fake-claude` to hit the worker endpoints. **9c:** `//go:build e2e` real-`claude` smoke (gated on `claude` on PATH).

## Commands

```bash
# Build all three binaries into ./bin/

# Tests
make test-unit                            # go test ./...
make test-integration                     # builds binaries first, then runs tagged tests
go test ./internal/store/ -run TestName   # single unit test

make clean
```

Go toolchain is pinned to **1.25.0** via `.tool-versions` (asdf). `go vet ./...` on an empty module returns exit 1 — use `go list -m` to sanity-check the module instead.

## Architecture

### Process model

`wrapd` is a long-lived daemon owning all state. Clients (`wrap` CLI, future TUI, intake adapters) talk to it over a Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wrap.sock` (falls back to `$TMPDIR/wrap.sock`). State dir defaults to `~/.wrap/` (override with `WRAP_STATE_DIR`); SQLite lives at `<state-dir>/wrap.db`. Future workers (`claude -p` subprocesses) will run in `git worktree`-isolated dirs and report progress over MCP back to the daemon.

### Package layering (strict — preserve when extending)

- `cmd/*/main.go` — wiring only, no business logic.
- `internal/store/` — owns all SQL and the `*sql.DB`. **No other package imports `database/sql` directly.** Schema is embedded from `schema.sql` via `go:embed` and applied on `Open()`.
- `internal/api/` — `http.Server` over `net.UnixListener`. Handlers are thin: delegate persistence to `store`, use `intake` DTOs for wire serialization.
- `internal/intake/` — canonical DTOs (`SubmitRunRequest`, etc.) **and** the `RunSubmitter` interface. The API and the CLI adapter both use these types so the contract lives in one place.
- `internal/client/` — HTTP client over the Unix socket; mirrors `api/` from the caller side. `*client.Client` implicitly satisfies `intake.RunSubmitter`.
- `internal/ids/` — ULID helper (`ids.New()`); use for all primary keys.
- `internal/testutil/` — test infrastructure (see below).

### Two integration-test strategies

- `testutil.StartInProcessServer(t)` — spins up a real `api.Server` + `store.Store` inside the test process. Use for tests that exercise daemon logic without needing a separate binary.
- `testutil.StartTestDaemon(t, wrapdBinary)` — spawns the actual `wrapd` binary. Use for true end-to-end tests (e.g. CLI → real daemon → DB). Requires `make wrapd` to have run; `testutil.LocateBinary("wrapd")` walks up to find `./bin/`.

The two helpers are intentionally distinct; don't unify them.

### Project conventions worth knowing

- **Error sentinels at boundaries.** Store exports `store.ErrNotFound`; callers use `errors.Is(err, store.ErrNotFound)` rather than `sql.ErrNoRows`. This keeps `database/sql` confined to the store package.
- **`store.Project.VerificationCommand` is plain `string`**, not `sql.NullString` — emptiness, not nullability, is the semantic.
- **`api.Server.Ready() <-chan struct{}`** — fires once the Unix socket is bound. `wrapd`'s startup banner waits on this so "listening on..." only prints when the socket is actually accept-ready. Preserve this when adding startup work.
- **Default gates JSON** is embedded as a literal in `api/handlers.go` (`findOrCreateProject`): `plan`/`merge` = `require_approval`, `worker_done` = `auto`. The gate engine (`internal/gates`) parses this per run; the literal could still move into a typed config later.
- **`fake-claude`** is env-driven (`FAKE_CLAUDE_EXIT_CODE`, `FAKE_CLAUDE_SLEEP_MS`, `FAKE_CLAUDE_STDOUT`, `FAKE_CLAUDE_STDERR`). Later phases will extend it to emit scripted MCP tool calls — keep it env-driven, no flags.
- **`--planner-env` values cannot contain commas.** The wrapd flag parses comma-separated `K=V` pairs; values with commas will be silently truncated. If future test fixtures need comma-bearing env values, switch the flag to a repeated `--planner-env` pattern.
- **Worker-RPC over NDJSON, not real MCP yet.** `internal/workerrpc` uses method names (`report_progress`, `report_plan`, `report_done`, `report_blocked`) chosen to match the eventual MCP tool surface. When real MCP lands (Phase 9), swap the transport, keep the method names. `DecodeAll` returns a `malformed` count — non-zero means a worker protocol bug; the orchestrator logs it.
- **`--planner-cmd` is bare path only in Phase 2.** No args support. Phase 9 will introduce a richer template with `--mcp wrap --append-system-prompt <planner.md>` args.
- **Process-group kill for worker subprocesses.** `internal/supervisor` sets `SysProcAttr.Setpgid = true` and kills via `syscall.Kill(-pid, SIGKILL)` so shell-wrapper grandchildren don't leak pipe handles. POSIX-only; the project intentionally has no Windows target.
- **Orchestrator writes plan BEFORE phase update.** In `drivePlanner`, `InsertPlan` runs before `UpdateRunPhase("plan_gate")`. Polling clients that condition on `phase == plan_gate` can rely on `plan_md` being present — there is no observable window where the phase has advanced but the plan is missing.
- **The gate engine: API resolves gates, the orchestrator owns phase transitions.** `POST /runs/{id}/approve|reject` only flips the pending `gates` row; the orchestrator observes the resolution on its next tick and advances the FSM. Never mutate `runs.phase` from a handler — the orchestrator is the single writer of phase.
- **Open the gate when ENTERING the gated phase.** `drivePlanner`/`driveMerger` call `openGate` to create the plan/merge gate *before* advancing to `plan_gate`/`merge_gate`, so a client that observes the gated phase always sees the pending gate (same no-window invariant as plan-before-phase). The gate-drivers (`drivePlanGate`/`driveMergeGate`) then only observe + act.
- **Gate policy defaults to `require_approval`.** `gates.Policy.Mode(kind)` returns `require_approval` for any kind not explicitly `auto` — never auto-approve the unspecified. Tests that want straight-through flow set an explicit `auto` `gates_json`.
- **`worker_blocked`/`merge_conflict` gates are deferred.** Phase 5 implements only the automatic plan/merge gates. A `report_blocked` worker still maps to `failed` (Phase 3 behavior); pausing mid-phase for a human is a later (failure-mode) phase.
- **Worker worktrees/branches are RETAINED on every path.** `driveWorkers` never calls `worktree.Remove` — surviving worker branches are the merger's inputs (Phase 4), and the spec forbids deleting failed worktrees until `wrap prune`. This is the deliberate opposite of `drivePlanner`, which removes its worktree after persisting the plan.
- **Worker terminal predicate lives in `interpretWorkerOutcome`.** `report_done` AND exit 0 → `done`; `report_blocked` → `failed` (blocked wins even if `report_done` was also emitted — it asked for human judgment); anything else (nonzero exit, or exit 0 without `report_done`) → `failed`. The daemon never parses worker stdout for meaning beyond these RPC methods.
- **`max_workers` is a daemon flag (`--max-workers`, default 4), NOT a schema column yet.** The spec wants it per-run defaulted from project; deferred to avoid a migration. Phase 5 should move it into per-run config alongside gates.
- **`git worktree add` is serialized** in `driveWorkers` via a mutex (repo-wide ref/index locks collide under parallel adds). Only the quick plumbing serializes; worker subprocesses still run concurrently under the cap.
- **`store.Worker.ExitCode` is `*int64`**, not `int64` — exit code 0 (success) must be distinguishable from "not yet finished" (NULL). Contrast the `0 = unset` sentinel used for `PID`/`StartedAt`/`EndedAt`, where 0 is never a real value.
- **No `merges` table — the merge result lives in the `events` log.** Per the canonical schema (no merges table), `driveMerger` records a `merge_done` event (payload `{branch, summary}`); `GET /runs/{id}` reads the latest one for `merge_branch`/`merge_summary`. The merged branch is always `wrap/<run>/merge` (derivable). Worker outcomes are likewise events (`worker_done`/`worker_blocked`/`worker_failed`); the merger reads `worker_done` summaries to build its context.
- **`Tick` drives every non-terminal phase via `driveByPhase`; gates hold runs, not flags.** `merging` is automatic work — `driveMerger` self-guards when `MergerCmd == nil` (run rests at `merging`). `plan_gate`/`merge_gate` are held by the gate policy, not a flag. `--merger-cmd` defaults to `claude` like planner/worker.
- **Kill writes state in the API; the orchestrator cancels work.** `POST /runs/{id}/kill` only sets `phase=killed` + rejects the pending gate (`resolved_by=killed_by_user`); it never touches subprocesses. The orchestrator's `WatchKills` goroutine polls for `killed` runs and cancels their registered run-scoped context (registered by `driveWorkers`/`driveMerger`), so `internal/supervisor`'s process-group SIGKILL reaps the children. Drive functions re-check `isKilled` before advancing so they never overwrite the terminal `killed` phase. Same single-writer-of-phase discipline as gates.
- **Worker retries live in `runWorker`, not the scheduler.** `RetryBudget` extra attempts on *retryable* failures only (crash = nonzero/no `report_done`; timeout). `report_blocked` and worktree-add failures are NOT retried. Each attempt is its own `workers` row (forensics). Timeout = the step context deadline firing (a hard runtime ceiling); a distinct *idle* timeout is deferred.
- **`Reconcile` runs once at `wrapd` startup, before the tick loop.** It fails runs caught mid-active-phase (`planning`/`working`/`merging`) — resuming mid-subprocess is unsafe — but leaves gate/pending runs for the loop to resume. Full mid-working resume (continue from already-`done` workers) is a deferred nicety. Reasons live in events (`daemon_recovered`, `worker_failed{reason:daemon_restart}`), not new columns.
- **The daemon never runs `verification_command`.** Per "daemon never parses output for meaning," the merger *subprocess* runs verification and only reports done if it passes; the daemon passes the command in the merge context (stdin) and trusts the merger's `report_done`/exit code. `driveMerger` reuses `interpretWorkerOutcome` — the merger's done-predicate is identical to a worker's.
- **`testutil.StartInProcessServerWithStore`** returns the backing `*store.Store` alongside the socket, so handler tests can seed state (events, etc.) that has no API write path. `StartInProcessServer` delegates to it. Still distinct from `StartTestDaemon` (external binary) — don't unify those.
- **TUI: test `Model.Update` + the commands, never snapshot `View()`** (per spec). `internal/tui` talks to a `tui.DaemonClient` interface (`*client.Client` satisfies it), so `Update` transitions and the `tea.Cmd`s are unit-tested with a fake client — no daemon, no rendered-output golden files. The TUI is poll-based (`tea.Tick`); it owns no daemon logic and writes only via the existing `approve`/`reject` endpoints. `cmd/wrap` stays wiring-only: it builds a `client.New(...)` and calls `tui.Run`.
- **Dependencies are no longer stdlib-only.** Phase 6 added `charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `lipgloss` (spec mandates Bubble Tea). Earlier phases were stdlib + `modernc.org/sqlite` + `oklog/ulid`; keep new deps justified by the spec.

### Adapter-pattern intake

Three intake adapters live in `internal/intake/`: `cli.go` (`wrap run`), `specfile.go` (`wrap submit`, frontmatter-aware), `github.go` (`wrap github`, issue→run). All produce a `SubmitRunRequest` and call `RunSubmitter.SubmitRun` — do not bypass the API by talking to the store directly; go through the socket like every other client.

- **Adapter logic stays pure/interface-driven in `intake`; `cmd/wrap` wires the subprocess impls.** `GitHubAdapter` depends on an `IssueFetcher` interface and emission depends on `intake.EmitDeps` (sidecar writer, push+PR func); the real `gh issue view` / `git push` + `gh pr create` impls live in `cmd/wrap/adapters.go`. Tests use fakes — no network, no `gh` required.
- **GitHub uses the `gh` CLI**, not a Go GitHub library (reuses the user's auth, zero new deps).
- **Specfile frontmatter is minimal flat `key: value`** between leading `---` fences (no YAML dep); unknown keys ignored; no frontmatter ⇒ whole file is the spec body.
- **Emission is pull-based** (`wrap emit <run-id>`), dispatched by `intake_kind` read from `GET /runs/{id}`. The run must be `done`. The spec's long-poll server-push auto-dispatch is deferred; `emit` is the manual trigger.

### What is NOT in scope (per spec)

Multi-tenant/multi-user, remote workers, recursive worker spawning, agentic orchestration of supervision (the FSM is deterministic Go), cross-project plan portability. Don't add abstraction for any of these without spec revision.

## Development workflow

This repo uses the `superpowers` skill set heavily. The user prefers extensible/adapter designs over narrow MVPs — when offering options, lead with the flexible one. TDD with frequent commits is the norm; phase plans are structured as bite-sized test-first tasks.
